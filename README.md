üìÇ Assignment: 01
Introduction to JAVA Program and concept of Data Types and Concept of Variables and Operators
1)Write a java program to print MCKVIE and Computer Science & Engineering. Apply \n in your program.
2)Write a java program which will take radius of a Circle as user input and calculate area and perimeter to display the results.
3)Using command line argument write a java program to print Object Oriented Programming Using Java.
4)Write a java program to swap two variables with and without using third variable.
5)Consider the basic pay of an employee as user input. AGP is 50% of the basic pay. Company provides 50% DA and 15% HRA on the merged basic (Basic + AGP). Write a java program to calculate and display total salary of the employee.

üìÇ Assignment: 02 / Concept of Operators and Conditional Statement and Concept of Loop Structure
1)Write a java program to identify largest among three numbers using Conditional Operator.
2)In general an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0 is known as a quadratic equation. Accept the values of a, b, and c from the user and write a java program to calculate the roots of the given quadratic equation.
3)Write a java program to check whether a year is Leap Year or not.
4)Write a java program to calculate y = xn, where x and n are user inputs, using loop.
5)Write a java program to generate Fibonacci Series up-to n terms using loop.

üìÇAssignment: 03
1)Write a java program to generate all Prime Numbers within a range, where range is user input.
2)Write a java program to reverse a number and check whether it is a Palindrome.
3)Write a program to check a given number is a magic number or not. A number is said to be a Magic number if the sum of its digits are calculated till a single digit is obtained by recursively adding the sum of its digits. If the single digit comes to be 1 then the number is a magic number. Example- 199 is a magic number as 1+9+9=19 but 19 is not a single digit number so 1+9=10 and then 1+0=1 which is a single digit number and also 1. Hence it is a magic number. Print all the magic numbers within a given range
4)Write a menu driven java program to sort a list on n numbers using the following sorting techniques: (a)Bubble Sort. (b) Selection sort. (c) Insertion Sort.

üìÇ Assignment: 04
1)Create a class Room which will store length and breadth of the room in two variables. Create another class Roomdemo which will use earlier class, also stores the height of the room. create instances of Roomdemo, set the values of length, breadth and height of the room. Calculate volume of the rooms.
2)Write a java program to overload a function rect()
void rect (int, char)- With one integer argument and one-character argument draw a filled square of side n using character stored in ch.
void rect(int, int, char) ‚Äì With two integer argument and one character argument draw a filled rectangle of length l and width b using characters stored in ch.
3)Declare a class student that represents the following hierarchical information- id, name (First, Middle, Last), Gender, DOB (day, month, year), marks of 3 subjects considering an 1D array (English, Mathematics, Computer Science). To store the name and DOB use the concept aggregation. Write a java program to store and display the database of n students by using array of objects. Also write methods to search a particular student (based on id or name) from array and display his/her details.

üìÇ Assignment: 05
5.1: Write a Java program where multiple inheritance is achieved through interface.
5.2: Write a Java program in which interface is given by name 'MeanInterface'. Method mean() is defined in this interface that calculates the mean of the given numbers arranged in an array. This interface is then extended and the method is defined in this interface that calculates the deviation from the mean value evaluated for each of the numbers.

üìÇ Assignment: 06
1)Develop an abstract class ‚ÄúGeometricObject‚Äù which will have two member variables color and weight. It would have constructor function for setting the color as ‚ÄúWhite‚Äù and weight as ‚Äú1.0‚Äù as default values. The class should have methods getColor() and getWeight() to return the color and weight values to the caller. The class should have two abstract methods findArea() and findCircumference(). Write a subclass for ‚ÄúGeometricObject‚Äù called ‚ÄúTriangle‚Äù which will able to calculate area and circumference for a triangle.
2)Write a Java Program to create an abstract class named Shape that contains two integers and an empty method named print Area(). Provide three classes named Rectangle, Triangle and Circle such that each one of the classes extends the class Shape. Each one of the classes contains only the method print Area () that prints the area of the given shape.

üìÇ Assignment: 07
1)Write appropriate java codes to describing different scenarios for accessing members/methods within the same package and different packages.
2)Create your own package having an interface called addmul with two methods add( ) and show ( ). Create three different implementations of that interface to add either 2 integers, or 2 double or 2 strings. Create your own method outside the package.

üìÇ Assignment: 08 / Concept of Exception Handling
1)Write a code segment in Try block where divide by zero occurs, also write corresponding catch block to catch the exception that occurs in the try block. Print the origin of the exception caught.
2)Create an array of 10 integers and assign an integer in location 15 of the array. Print the appropriate message in catch block. Considering the same assignment write two catch block one to catch the ‚ÄúException‚Äù another for exception ‚ÄúArrayIndexOutofBoundsException‚Äù. In first catch block re-throw the exception caught. In second catch block print the origin of the exception.
3)Write a java code segments that results a ‚ÄúNullPointerException‚Äù. Write a necessary catch block to handle the exception. Also write a finally block with appropriate statements in it.
4)Create a superclass Mathexception and two subclasses Overflowexception and UnderflowException. Write a code segment that throws an Overflowexception. Write two catch block Overflowexception and UnderflowException. Instantiate an integer variable and initialize with some value. If the value is greater than 100 an OverFlowException is thrown otherwise an UnderFlowException is thrown, handle the exception with appropriate message.

üìÇ Assignment: 09
Problem 1: Write a Java program to demonstrate the creation and execution of threads. Define a class that extends the Thread class or implements the Runnable interface, and within it, print a message multiple times to show concurrent execution. Create at least two threads and observe how the output varies when both threads run simultaneously.
Problem 2: Write a Java program that creates two threads to print a sequence of numbers in different orders. The first thread should print numbers from 1 to 10 in ascending order, while the second thread should print numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. In the second thread, when the number reaches 6, the thread should pause its execution for 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds) before continuing. The program should demonstrate the use of the Thread class, the start() and run() methods, and the sleep() method to control thread timing and execution behavior.
Problem 3: Write a Java program that demonstrates synchronization and coordination between two threads operating on shared data. Create a class with two instance variables, a and b, both of integer type. Define two methods: add() and increase(). The add() method should copy the values of a and b into local variables, pause for 0.5 seconds, add the two values, and print the result. The increase() method should increase both a and b by 5, wait for 0.5 seconds, and print the updated values. Create two separate threads to perform these tasks, ensuring that the add thread starts first, followed by the increase thread.

üìÇ Assignment: 10
1)Write a java program to print "Hello World" through applet.
2)Write an applet to sum to integer numbers.
3)Create an applet to draw a smiling face.
4)Write an applet code to display an image.
